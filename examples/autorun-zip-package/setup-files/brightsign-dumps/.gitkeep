# The brightsign-dumps directory is automatically used by BrightSignOS to store

# crash dumps and diagnostic information when the application encounters issues.

# This information is invaluable for BrightSign Support when troubleshooting problems.

#

# This directory is optional but highly recommended for production applications.

#

# You can safely delete this file once crash dumps are generated.
